# hello-world
This is me, saying hello.

My name is Rachael, you can call me Rae. I'm a Mechanical Engineering student in Utah. I am seriously debating whether to change to a "Big Data" oriented field or not. 

Either way, I hear as long as you practice coding on the side, the degree isn't necessarily a deal-breaker or maker.
